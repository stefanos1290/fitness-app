      "For some people, the challenge is falling asleep. For others, falling asleep is easy, but staying asleep throughout the night is not. Both are symptoms of insomnia, a commonly reported sleep problem that affects about 30% of adults in America. Being unable to sleep is not only frustrating, it can have significant health consequences. Poor sleep has been linked to headaches, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, dementia and more. Safety is another issue: Driving while drowsy can be similar to driving under the influence of alcohol and is a leading cause of accidents. While sleep aids available over the counter or by prescription can help, they often have unwanted side effects including morning grogginess and difficulty concentrating the next day. Even some prescription medications, while intended for short-term use, can become habit-forming. Learn to Sleep Better Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I, can help you teach your body to sleep better without medication. CBT-I involves evaluating how you think about sleep (the cognitive part) and how you act (the behavioral part). Negative thoughts about sleep can make the problem worse; for example, if you lie awake in bed worried that you will never get back to sleep, or you spend the day dreading yet another sleepless night, you’re even less likely to sleep well. The behavioral aspect focuses on changing bad sleep habits and developing positive ones that support healthy sleep. Many CBT-I therapists are psychologists or behavioral health specialists certified in Behavioral Sleep Medicine (BSM), but certification is not required. Often, the first step in CBT-I is keeping a “sleep diary” that details how well (or poorly) you sleep every day, including what you do before bed, what time you go to bed and wake up, how you feel and other information that may be helpful in identifying detrimental thoughts or behaviors. After a week or two of tracking, your therapist will review your results with you and identify areas that need attention. Sleep 101 Depending on your specific cognitive and behavioral issues, your CBT-I will recommend at least one of the following techniques; many people combine several techniques for better results. Relaxation training helps you learn to turn off the “noise” in your head and prepare your mind and body for rest. Popular activities include using a guided relaxation or meditation app, listening to soothing music, taking a bath and deep breathing. The best techniques are the ones that work for you, so experiment until you find your favorites. Also, avoid potentially stressful activities close to bedtime, such as watching the news or checking work emails. Stimulus control therapy teaches you to take control of factors that serve as positive or negative cues for sleep. One of the most common recommendations is to use your bed only for sleep and sex. Avoid watching television, surfing the Internet or doing other non-sleep activities in bed or even in the bedroom. Establish a “bedtime routine” such as reading a book, meditating or other activity that tells your body to prepare for sleep. Try to go to bed and wake up at about the same times every day. If you’re in bed and can’t sleep, get up and go into another room until you are sleepy again. This helps you avoid associating the bed with being unable to sleep.  Sleep hygiene therapy concerns your lifestyle habits and how they may affect sleep. For example, drinking caffeine after noon, exercising too close to bedtime, drinking alcohol and working up until bedtime can all interfere with falling or staying asleep. Blue light emitted by devices such as laptops, tablets and phones can suppress melatonin, which is the hormone that helps you fall and stay asleep. Avoid using your devices for an hour or so before bed or use the blue light filter or “night” setting if available. Sleep environment improvement involves creating a sleep-friendly setting. Common recommendations include keeping your bedroom cool and dark, blocking out noise (wear earplugs if necessary), charging your phone in another room and placing the clock out of view. Paradoxical intention for insomnia is trying to stay awake rather than trying to go to sleep. When you stop worrying about being able to sleep, you may actually be able to relax and find sleep comes easier—so try not to stress about it.",

      "Intermittent fasting: Surprising update.",

      "There’s a ton of incredibly promising intermittent fasting (IF) research done on fat rats. They lose weight, their blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugars improve… but they’re rats. Studies in humans, almost across the board, have shown that IF is safe and incredibly effective, but really no more effective than any other diet. In addition, many people find it difficult to fast. But a growing body of research suggests that the timing of the fast is key, and can make IF a more realistic, sustainable, and effective approach for weight loss, as well as for diabetes prevention. The backstory on intermittent fasting IF as a weight loss approach has been around in various forms for ages, but was highly popularized in 2012 by BBC broadcast journalist Dr. Michael Mosley’s TV documentary Eat Fast, Live Longer and book The Fast Diet, followed by journalist Kate Harrison’s book The 5:2 Diet based on her own experience, and subsequently by Dr. Jason Fung’s 2016 bestseller The Obesity Code. IF generated a steady positive buzz as anecdotes of its effectiveness proliferated. As a lifestyle-leaning research doctor, I needed to understand the science. The Obesity Code seemed the most evidence-based summary resource, and I loved it. Fung successfully combines plenty of research, his clinical experience, and sensible nutrition advice, and also addresses the socioeconomic forces conspiring to make us fat. He is very clear that we should eat more fruits and veggies, fiber, healthy protein, and fats, and avoid sugar, refined grains, processed foods, and for God’s sake, stop snacking. Check, check, check, I agree. The only part that was still questionable in my mind was the intermittent fasting part. Intermittent fasting can help weight loss IF makes intuitive sense. The food we eat is broken down by enzymes in our gut and eventually ends up as molecules in our bloodstream. Carbohydrates, particularly sugars and refined grains (think white flours and rice), are quickly broken down into sugar, which our cells use for energy. If our cells don’t use it all, we store it in our fat cells as, well, fat. But sugar can only enter our cells with insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas. Insulin brings sugar into the fat cells and keeps it there. Between meals, as long as we don’t snack, our insulin levels will go down and our fat cells can then release their stored sugar, to be used as energy. We lose weight if we let our insulin levels go down. The entire idea of IF is to allow the insulin levels to go down far enough and for long enough that we burn off our fat. Intermittent fasting can be hard… but maybe it doesn’t have to be Initial human studies that compared fasting every other day to eating less every day showed that both worked about equally for weight loss, though people struggled with the fasting days. So, I had written off IF as no better or worse than simply eating less, only far more uncomfortable. My advice was to just stick with the sensible, plant-based, Mediterranean-style diet. New research is suggesting that not all IF approaches are the same, and some are actually very reasonable, effective, and sustainable, especially when combined with a nutritious plant-based diet. So I’m prepared to take my lumps on this one (and even revise my prior post). We have evolved to be in sync with the day/night cycle, i.e., a circadian rhythm. Our metabolism has adapted to daytime food, nighttime sleep. Nighttime eating is well associated with a higher risk of obesity, as well as diabetes. Based on this, researchers from the University of Alabama conducted a study with a small group of obese men with prediabetes. They compared a form of intermittent fasting called “early time-restricted feeding,” where all meals were fit into an early eight-hour period of the day (7 am to 3 pm),or spread out over 12 hours (between 7 am and 7 pm). Both groups maintained their weight (did not gain or lose) but after five weeks, the eight-hours group had dramatically lower insulin levels and significantly improved insulin sensitivity, as well as significantly lower blood pressure. The best part? The eight-hours group also had significantly decreased appetite. They weren’t starving. Just changing the timing of meals, by eating earlier in the day and extending the overnight fast, significantly benefited metabolism even in people who didn’t lose a single pound. Why might changing timing help? But why does simply changing the timing of our meals to allow for fasting make a difference in our body? An in-depth review of the science of IF recently published in New England Journal of Medicine sheds some light. Fasting is evolutionarily embedded within our physiology, triggering several essential cellular functions. Flipping the switch from a fed to fasting state does more than help us burn calories and lose weight. The researchers combed through dozens of animal and human studies to explain how simple fasting improves metabolism, lowering blood sugar; lessens inflammation, which improves a range of health issues from arthritic pain to asthma; and even helps clear out toxins and damaged cells, which lowers risk for cancer and enhances brain function. The article is deep, but worth a read! So, is intermittent fasting as good as it sounds? I was very curious about this, so I asked the opinion of metabolic expert Dr. Deborah Wexler, Director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes Center and associate professor at Harvard Medical School. Here is what she told me. “There is evidence to suggest that the circadian rhythm fasting approach, where meals are restricted to an eight to 10-hour period of the daytime, is effective,” she confirmed, though generally she recommends that people “use an eating approach that works for them and is sustainable to them.” So, here’s the deal. There is some good scientific evidence suggesting that circadian rhythm fasting, when combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle, can be a particularly effective approach to weight loss, especially for people at risk for diabetes. (However, people with advanced diabetes or who are on medications for diabetes, people with a history of eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia, and pregnant or breastfeeding women should not attempt intermittent fasting unless under the close supervision of a physician who can monitor them.) 4 ways to use this information for better health Avoid sugars and refined grains. Instead, eat fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (a sensible, plant-based, Mediterranean-style diet). Let your body burn fat between meals. Don’t snack. Be active throughout your day. Build muscle tone. Consider a simple form of intermittent fasting. Limit the hours of the day when you eat, and for best effect, make it earlier in the day (between 7 am to 3 pm, or even 10 am to 6 pm, but definitely not in the evening before bed). Avoid snacking or eating at nighttime, all the time.",

      "Benefits of Hiking: Physical, Mental and Beyond.",

      "How do you feel after you go for a hike or spend time outdoors? Do you have a tendency to feel less stressed, more focused and more relaxed? If so, that is not a coincidence. Or maybe you haven’t tried hiking, yet you are intrigued by what it has to offer. Hiking offers a variety of benefits, both physical and mental. Some benefits may be immediate (such as reduced blood pressure and stress levels, heightened focus and an increase in immune function), whereas other benefits may develop over time, such as weight loss and a decrease in depression. Physical Health Benefits Hiking is cardiovascular in nature, so it can provide great benefit to heart health while also improving blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Hiking helps increase the strength in the leg muscles, builds stability in the core muscles and enhances balance skills. The more technical the terrain is, along with an increase in climbing intensity, the more balance and core strength is required because more muscles are being recruited to manage the steeper terrain. As you climb, the larger muscles in your legs are activated (such as the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings and calves), and on the descent, your glutes and quadriceps are working hard to prevent you from falling forward on the decline. Uneven terrain means many of the smaller stabilizer muscles are being worked, which increases stability and balance overall. The intensity of a hike can be altered to fit the ability of the person hiking, from a simple hiking path in a neighborhood to a challenging climb up a mountain, which makes hiking accessible to all abilities and across all ages. The hillier the trail is, the harder your heart will work, therefore increasing the potential cardiovascular benefit. Mental Health Benefits Research suggests that hiking mountainous areas with altitude differences can increase feelings of valence (pleasure), elation (or happiness) and calmness, and feelings of anxiety and fatigue may decrease immediately after hiking. For example, one study showed a reduction in stress-related responses such as lower levels of cortisol (a stress hormone) in saliva after hiking outdoors. A study by researchers at Stanford University showed that spending time in nature reduces rumination, or the repetitive thought patterns about negative emotions. This same study demonstrated that spending time in nature may improve mental well-being as well as provide people who live in urban areas the reprieve they need for reducing negative thought patterns. In fact, study participants experienced a decrease in subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC) brain activity, which is a part of the brain associated with withdrawal and is linked to rumination for both healthy individuals and those experiencing depression. Furthermore, being in nature decreases anxiety and includes some benefits such as an increase in cognition and affect, or feelings and emotions Being in nature may also provide the opportunity to be more mindful and present to the moment you’re experiencing, which has been shown to reduce stress and blood pressure. How to Get Started Clearly, spending time in nature has the power to make us feel better, both physically and mentally, so what can you do to get started? First, start with shorter hikes on more familiar trails that are near you—this will make it easier for you to get started. Stiffer-soled shoes can help support your feet by providing a more stable grip on uneven and potentially slippery terrain (hiking-specific footwear is ideal). A good pair of shoes can also help prevent ankle injuries or falls as you start hiking (and when you may have less leg strength and overall stability). Ideally, these shoes should be well broken-in to reduce the potential for blisters. Come prepared with ample fluid and a few snacks (even if you don’t think you will be outside for very long) and be sure to wear clothes appropriate for the weather. Dress in layers to help you stay warm in cooler climates, and be sure to wear sunscreen, even on cloudy days. Have a clear understanding of the route you will take by using a map or an application on your smartphone. Even better, bring a friend along to join you on the hike, which can help make the time more enjoyable and enhance your feelings of connection (which is also important for positive mental health). It is also important to let someone know where you will be hiking in case of an emergency situation. Provide the name and location of the trail and when you expect to return. Give it a Try Give hiking a try and see how it feels physically, mentally, and emotionally—if nothing else, it can give you a chance to step away from the screens and technology that characterize daily life and focus more of your energy on nature and your surroundings, which can bring a moment of mindfulness to your day.",

      "What is Behavior Change and How Does It Relate to Training?",
    author: "Dr. Erin Nitschke",
    date: "October 22, 2020",

    blog:
      "Humans are capable of, and familiar with, change. As we experience life, we grow and change—not just physically, but mentally, emotionally, socially, intellectually and spiritually as well. At first glance, the concepts of change and changing a behavior seem simplistic because humans are adaptable and change is not uncommon, even when we aren’t conscious of it. If we take a more microscopic view, however, changing health behaviors is actually a complex and progressive experience influenced by a number of factors. By its given nature, behavior change is inherently challenging because “lifestyles evolve for various reasons over many years, and people behave the way they do because their behaviors ‘work’ for them” (ACE, 2019). It’s simply not easy to change a behavior or a set of behaviors without some element of struggle because our behaviors are influenced by friends, family, work, stress, sleep, environment, life experiences and general health. What Behavior Change Isn’t Behavior change is a goal-driven process, not a singular event. For this reason, changes in health behavior are rarely achieved or maintained without effort. Meaningful and sustainable behavior change occurs in stages or phases. How long this process takes is unique to each person—there’s no finite or research-based “due date” for change. Further, behavior change is nonlinear. This means that it is normal, common and even expected for an individual to move back and forth between different stages. And, while lapses are part of the process, they should not be viewed as reasons to give up and abandon the ultimate goal or adopt an “I’ve failed” mindset. Behavior Change and the Fitness Connection Getting in shape and staying in shape, like behavior change, is a goal-driven process. How fitness goals are accomplished relates to the daily behaviors and choices a person makes. These choices will either support or detract from the fitness journey. For example, a person has a goal of being physically active for 30 minutes each day. There are specific behaviors and choices that will support this goal. Supportive behaviors and choices may include getting enough quality sleep, staying properly hydrated, eating nutrient-dense foods and setting aside the necessary block of time to exercise. By contrast, if this person chooses to get minimal sleep and consume less-nutritious foods (chips, cookies, fried foods, etc.), they likely will not feel energized and motivated enough to be active. Choices such as these will detract from the overall goal. As a result, this person would likely experience frustration and disappointment. Changing behaviors and making the healthy choice the easy choice is key to getting (and staying) in shape. Steps You Can Take to Make Positive Change Remember, both change and getting in shape are goal-driven processes. To begin, identify a long-term or product goal (what you want to accomplish in 6-12 months) and two or three short-term or process goals (something that is more immediately achievable that will lead you to the long-term goal). Short-term process goals should be related to the behavior and the choices you will make. Making the desired choice or performing a desired behavior accomplishes the goal versus goal attainment being based on an outcome (i.e., weight loss). Consider this example: Long-term goal: I will run my first 5K race in six months. Short-term goals that support the achievement of the long-term goal may include the following: Starting next week I will complete 20 minutes of running on Tuesday, Thursdays, and Saturdays and increase my duration by 10% each week. I will eat three servings of fruits and veggies daily. Starting in week 3, I will perform resistance training focusing on total-body exercises on Mondays and Wednesdays each week. Your long-term and short-term goals will differ from this example but the key point to remember is to set goals that are SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) and that focus on changing behaviors rather than a product or outcome. If weight loss is a desire, and for many it is, changing behaviors and making healthier choices will naturally result in improved health metrics such as weight and body composition. Second, journal your progress and behavioral choices. While this might seem daunting, journaling is an effective way to self-monitor as it allows you a consistent opportunity to reflect upon and address such points as: If the weekly goal was achieved Barriers you encountered How you overcame those barriers What behaviors or choices you made that supported (or detracted from) your weekly goal Steps you’ll take for the following week to continue to support your efforts Third, plan for high-risk situations. High-risk situations are instances or events in which you are tempted to make choices that may not support what you’re trying to accomplish. For example, pastries in the break room, holiday parties, and event gatherings where high-calorie foods and drinks are served, travel, etc. Create a  plan for staying on track during these times and identify strategies you can use to help yourself. Next, identify individuals in your network who can provide social support, additional motivation and structure to your change process. Enlist the help of a spouse, friend, neighbor, colleague, or other support groups that you can talk to about your change journey and fitness goals. This helps keep you accountable and provides you with a sounding board to share successes and stumbles. Finally, keep track of your food intake (not calorie for calorie, necessarily, but items of food/quality of food), hydration, stress level and sleep quality. Without tracking, we aren’t able to identify patterns of behavior that may be influenced by outside stressors or factors. We tend to make less conscious choices when we aren’t holding ourselves accountable. Research different apps that might help you in this process. Getting in shape requires making healthy choices to support the effort it takes to achieve a fitness goal. To make healthy, conscious choices, engaging in behaviors that facilitate making the most reasonable and supportive choice is essential. For many, this means implementing meaningful changes to develop new habits. The process is challenging, but behavior change is the path forward to a fit life.",

      "5 Simple Habits to Make You Healthier and Happier.",
    author: "Elizabeth Andrews",

    blog:
      "Happiness has become a popular field of study for researchers over the last decade, and universities are creating whole courses around the topic. Dr. Laurie Santos, a professor in psychology and cognitive science, teaches a hugely popular course on happiness at Yale and is a leading researcher on the science of happiness. Through her research, she has developed science-based recommendations on how we can increase our happiness levels. Here are five simple ways we can create happier, healthier lives for ourselves. 1. List three things you feel grateful for every day According to Santos, writing down three awesome things about your day can have a significant effect on retraining your brain to feel more gratitude and, as a result, feel happier. Pairing this practice with another habit, such as brushing your teeth, can enhance your awareness and make it easier to remember to do each day. Becoming more aware of the things for which you feel grateful—even small things such as your morning cup of coffee or a call from a friend—is a great way to help you focus on the positives in your life rather than the things you may perceive to be lacking. 2. Get moving People who are physically active for even small amounts of time each week (150 minutes or less) have lower odds for developing depression And the options for adding activity to your day are endless. Take your dog for a walk, for example, or go to a playground and play on the equipment. Practice mobility drills while watching your favorite television show. Find stairs and take them. Go for an easy swim in a lake or work in the garden. The point is to get moving, whenever and wherever you can. 3. Spend time in nature and unplug The writer Anne Lamott wrote, “Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.” Taking time away from technology is important, particularly for those who feel overstimulated and fatigued by constant notifications and work-related stress. And if you can unplug outdoors, even better. David Strayer, a professor and cognitive psychologist, has been researching brain-based measures in cognitive restoration and believes that spending time in nature is important for elevating mood and reducing stress. For example, one study of people walking through an urban green space showed that participants’ brains exhibited lower frustration, engagement and arousal while in the green area. So get outside without any tech. Again, the possibilities are endless. Walk through a garden. Go hiking. Scramble up some rocks. Run barefoot in the grass. Rent a canoe. Listen and take it all in, allowing nature and its calming effects to wash over you. 4. Take care of others Acts of kindness make us happier and spending time caring for others is a great way to increase your happiness level, says Santos. “Spending time and money on ourselves isn’t as fulfilling as focusing your time and money on other people,” Santos explains. “Those that volunteer more, tend to be more on the happier side than those that do not volunteer.” Pure altruism—the kind that you want to do rather than feel obligated to—has long-lasting effects on happiness levels, so take some time to think about issues or causes that speak to you and consider what simple acts you can take to help. Could you offer to go grocery shopping for those who may be unable to leave their homes or take dinner to someone who recently had a baby? If you love nature, consider planting perennials for bees and butterflies. Send a friend a favorite book. Bring in your neighbor’s garbage cans. Send a card full of encouragement to someone who needs it, or volunteer for your favorite organization. Time spent helping others is time well spent. 5. Meditate So much of modern life is geared toward getting as much done as possible, which leads to increased stress and anxiety. Meditation is a way to use the breath to help calm the nervous system. When you breathe properly, the diaphragm stimulates the vagus nerve, which helps you connect to the parasympathetic system. Just 10 minutes a day can begin to change the patterns of your brain. While starting a meditation practice can feel challenging, here are some ideas on how to get started: Begin your day in silence, before you check your phone for emails or texts. Find a comfortable chair or go outside and find a peaceful spot where you can pause and bring awareness to your breath. Close your eyes and count your breaths for 10 minutes. You can also find many useful apps that will help guide your meditation practice, which can be particularly useful for beginners. While learning to meditate requires discipline and practice, it doesn’t have to require a lot of time and you don’t have to do it perfectly to reap the benefits.",

      "It should no longer come as breaking news when a new study supports what we’ve already known: Staying active promotes better longer-term health and reduces disease.The latest proof of the benefits of exercise comes from a recent study in the UK that discovered that not only those who engage in physical activity are at a lower risk of getting cardiovascular disease, but the more activity you engage in brings the risk down even more. In a study published recently in PLOS Medicine, researchers measured the physical activity of 90,211 participants through the use of an accelerometer, a small motion sensor strapped onto their wrists over a seven-day period between 2013 and 2015. From there they tracked each person’s health on average for five years. Out of all the participants, 3,617 cases of cardiovascular disease were diagnosed during follow-up over the five years. Most of those diagnosed with cardio disease smoked more, had higher body mass index and were diagnosed with hypertension, were also in the lowest category of physical activity, according to the study.What the study also showed was that there was no threshold as to reduced benefits for increased physical activity and cardiovascular disease. Those who exercised the most were anywhere between 49% and 57% less likely to come down with cardiovascular disease. ‘The results of this study enhance confidence that physical activity is likely to be an important way of preventing cardiovascular disease,” said Terry Dwyer, an Oxford professor of epidemiology and study lead author. “The potential risk reduction estimated in those engaging in relatively high levels of activity is substantial and justifies a greater emphasis on measures to increase levels of physical activity in the community. ”Another lead author, Oxford Associate Professor Aiden Doherty, said the study backed the World Health Organization’s recommendations that adults get in at minimum at the least anywhere from around 20 to 45 minutes each day of moderate to vigorous activity to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. “It shows that physical activity is probably even more important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease than we previously thought. ”In other words, movement— any type of movement, for a relatively short time each day, will benefit you and your heart for the long term.

    blog:
      "If 2020 taught us anything it’s that we must be ready to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. From how the world works, learns, shops and gathers, 2020 has been about finding new ways to do ordinary things, including going to the gym.The fitness and wellness industry saw some of the most significant changes as countries, regions and cities created COVID-19 mitigation plans that limited how fitness facilities could operate. Many closed or reduced their hours and Americans felt the effects. Research points to a wide range of health problems associated with a more sedentary lifestyle during COVID-19 lockdowns, including weight gain, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Some fitness facilities have continued to operate with streaming classes, outdoor workouts, and online programs for members. However, if your gym doesn’t offer online options, you may want alternative ideas for staying fit. Whether it’s in the comfort and safety of your own home or outside at a park, track, or other venues, there are many ways to stay active until the fitness world returns to normal. Fitness experts offer these tips for staying fit during the ever-changing COVID-19 restrictions: Make life your movement. Not every workout needs to be on a treadmill or in a spin class. Use everyday activities as opportunities to incorporate movement when pressed for time. Pick up the pace when walking the dog. Create a family workout challenge while playing with the kids. Make cleaning a cardio activity by adding in aerobic activities such as stair climbing. Step into a streaming class. Group fitness is a big attraction at gyms. If your gym doesn’t offer streaming classes, look for free online streaming workouts on platforms such as YouTube. Just search for your favorite class type (for example, “30-minute cardio HIIT” or “45-minute low-impact strength” and see what pops up. The offerings online are seemingly endless, with paid apps such as Daily Burn, Apple Fitness+ and Peloton offer monthly streaming packages as well. Create your own home gym. You don’t need expensive cardio equipment or a full rack of weights to create a home gym. Simply invest in a few affordable items to make working out at home easier, such as a good quality yoga mat, a basic set of dumbbells (5, 8 and 10 lbs. to start), a jump rope and a step/bench. With these items, you’ll have a home gym set-up that doesn’t overtake a room and can be stored easily. Explore your surroundings. COVID-19 may have closed down indoor exercise in your area but the great outdoors is still open for business (check local regulations and restrictions). Explore new parks, running trails, bike paths and bodies of water if weather permits in your part of the world. Outdoor exercise offers myriad benefits and challenges your body in different ways than using indoor equipment. Always follow COVID-19 safety recommendations, such as staying 6 feet apart, wearing a mask when you are around other people and proper handwashing when using public facilities. Work with a health and exercise professional online. Over the past year, numerous personal trainers and health coaches took their businesses online to help clients stay focused on their goals. Having a plan and someone to hold you accountable increases your chances of success. Find a qualified and experienced trainer who can support your goals online and provide that accountability. While the COVID-19 pandemic presents many uncertainties, one thing remains true: Your health and wellness should be a priority. Incorporating movement and finding support for your goals just takes some creativity and a willingness to explore new ways of fitting in movement.",
